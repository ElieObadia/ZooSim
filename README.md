# ZooSim - LogBook

### Tuesday Morning:

* Started by defining the classes for animals and plants, including their characteristics and methods for eating and reproducing.
* Created the Enclosure class, which can hold instances of animals and plants, and has methods for adding them, reporting their status, and simulating the passing of a day.

### Tuesday Afternoon:

* Implemented the ability for animals and plants to have a certain amount of health points and age, and for them to die if their health points reach 0 or their age reaches 20.
* Added the ability for plants to grow and animals to get hungry, and for them to eat and reproduce.

### Wednesday Morning:

* Worked on implementing the ability to save and load the current state of the enclosure to and from a file.
This will allow us to continue simulating the enclosure from where we left off, and also to keep a record of the history of the enclosure.

### Wednesday Afternoon:

* Finalized the code and added a main function to test and demonstrate the functionality of the program.
* Added the ability to save the report of the enclosure to a text file and added some additional error handling.


### Remarks
* I've chosen to analyse all the exercises that were about the enclosure behavior as a one problem to have a global view of the problem. This allowed me to avoid implementing function that may have needed deletion or big modifications.
* During this project, I had to think about how different plants and animals would act and interact within the enclosure, and figure out how to code those behaviors. I also had to think about how to keep track of everything's state and history within the enclosure. It was a challenging but interesting exercise in using object-oriented programming to mimic a complex system.
